The following four stan files are used the manuscript with the model described in Supplementary Materials' sections as follows:
1. ```1.incidence_estimation.stan``` = Incidence and case detection ratio estimation
2. ```2.lfd_pcr_relation.stan``` = Estimating false positivity rate, LFD test sensitivity and specificity
3. ```3.lfd_pcr_relation_ethnicityorage.stan``` = Estimating false positivity rate, LFD test sensitivity and specificity (letting it vary by ethnicity or age)
4. ```4.pcr_detection_decay.stan``` = Modelling the decline in PCR detection rate subsequent to reporting an LFD positive
